# Multi-Agent LLM System Design Report

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the system design and architectural choices for the multi-agent LLM system aimed at retrieving competitive intelligence from online sources for a Product Manager. The system focuses on tracking product updates within the **AI Productivity Tools** domain.

## 2. Framework Selection
**Chosen Framework: CrewAI**

**Rationale:**
CrewAI was selected for its robust capabilities in defining clear agent roles, tasks, and orchestrating complex workflows. Its declarative approach to building "crews" of agents aligns well with the requirement for distinct agent responsibilities (Search, Summarizer, Verifier). This framework is expected to simplify the management of communication and data flow between agents, providing a structured yet flexible environment for our multi-agent system.
;; CrewAI was selected as the primary framework for building the multi-agent LLM system due to its strong emphasis on defining clear agent roles, tasks, and its intuitive approach to orchestrating cooperative agent workflows. This aligns perfectly with the project's requirement for distinct Search, Summarizer, and Verifier agents, allowing for a structured and manageable pipeline of information processing. CrewAI's design simplifies the creation of autonomous agents that collaborate towards a common goal, which is essential for effectively retrieving and synthesizing competitive intelligence.

## 3. Agent Architecture

The system is designed with a minimum of three distinct agents, along with an optional Coordinator Agent to manage the overall pipeline.

### 3.1. SearchAgent
* **Purpose:** Responsible for fetching relevant online sources for a given product category/topic.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Takes the product category/topic as input.
    * Uses external search tools (e.g., DuckDuckGo Search, SerpAPI) to find relevant web pages (news, blogs, official updates).
    * [cite_start]Filters and selects the top 5 most relevant source URLs.
* **Input:** String (e.g., "AI Productivity Tools updates").
* **Output:** List of strings (URLs).

### 3.2. SummarizerAgent
* **Purpose:** To extract and summarize concise information from the content of the URLs provided by the SearchAgent.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Receives a list of URLs.
    * Utilizes a web scraping tool to extract content from each URL.
    * [cite_start]Leverages an LLM to summarize each update, specifically extracting: Product name, Summary of the update, Source link, and Date (if available).
    * [cite_start]Handles cases where content is missing or irrelevant gracefully.
* **Input:** List of strings (URLs).
* **Output:** List of dictionaries, each structured with `{"product": "", "update": "", "source": "", "date": ""}`.

### 3.3. VerifierAgent
* **Purpose:** To filter out unreliable, irrelevant, or potentially hallucinated information from the summaries generated by the SummarizerAgent.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Receives a list of structured summaries.
    * Evaluates each summary for relevance to the original query and factual accuracy.
    * Checks the reliability of the source if possible.
    * [cite_start]Filters out any summaries deemed unreliable or irrelevant.
* **Input:** List of structured summaries (dictionaries).
* **Output:** Filtered list of validated structured summaries (dictionaries).

### 3.4. CoordinatorAgent (Proposed)
* **Purpose:** To oversee the entire workflow, manage inter-agent communication, and ensure the final structured report is generated.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Initiates the process with the input topic.
    * Delegates tasks sequentially to SearchAgent, SummarizerAgent, and VerifierAgent.
    * [cite_start]Collects and formats the final output into the required Markdown or JSON structure.
    * [cite_start]Will also be responsible for handling potential errors and rate limits.
* **Input:** String (Initial product category/topic).
* **Output:** Formatted final report (Markdown or JSON string).

## 4. System Flow
The high-level data flow will be as follows:
1.  User provides `Product Category/Topic` input.
2.  `CoordinatorAgent` receives input and delegates to `SearchAgent`.
3.  `SearchAgent` returns `List of URLs`.
4.  `CoordinatorAgent` passes `List of URLs` to `SummarizerAgent`.
5.  `SummarizerAgent` returns `List of Raw Summaries`.
6.  `CoordinatorAgent` passes `List of Raw Summaries` to `VerifierAgent`.
7.  `VerifierAgent` returns `List of Validated Summaries`.
8.  `CoordinatorAgent` formats the `List of Validated Summaries` into the final `Structured Report` (Markdown/JSON).

## 5. Initial Challenges and Considerations
* [cite_start]**Tool Integration:** Ensuring robust integration with external tools like search APIs and web scrapers, including handling of rate limits and potential API key management.
* [cite_start]**Relevance Filtering:** Accurately identifying and filtering irrelevant information at both the search and verification stages[cite: 31, 50].
* [cite_start]**Hallucination Mitigation:** Designing effective prompts and verification steps to minimize LLM hallucinations in summaries.
* **Data Extraction Accuracy:** Ensuring the SummarizerAgent consistently extracts the required fields (product name, date, etc.) accurately from varied web content.
* [cite_start]**Memory and Logging:** Implementing effective logging for traceability and short-term memory to avoid redundant queries[cite: 56, 57].
