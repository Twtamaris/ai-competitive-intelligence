# Multi-Agent LLM System for Competitive Intelligence

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a multi-agent LLM system to retrieve competitive intelligence from online sources and present structured insights. This simulates an AI assistant for a Product Manager, focusing on the **AI Productivity Tools** domain.

## Installation and Running
*(To be filled out during implementation. Placeholder for now.)*

To run this project:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Twtamaris/ai-competitive-intelligence.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ai-competitive-intelligence`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
4. Set up environment variables (e.g., API keys).
5. Run the main script: `python main.py` (This file will be created later)

## Architecture and Agent Design
*(To be filled out during agent design and implementation. Placeholder for now.)*

This section will describe:
* The overall system architecture (e.g., how agents interact).
* The specific roles and responsibilities of each agent (e.g., Scraper Agent, Analysis Agent, Reporting Agent).
* The technologies and frameworks used (e.g., LangChain, CrewAI, Autogen).

## TO-DOs and Known Limitations
*(To be continuously updated throughout the project.)*

### Current TO-DOs:
* [ ] Implement web scraping functionalities.
* [ ] Design and define agent roles and interactions.
* [ ] Integrate LLM for analysis and summarization.
* [ ] Develop structured output generation.
* [ ] Implement testing and validation procedures.
* [ ] Refine installation instructions.
* [ ] Detail architecture and agent design.

### Known Limitations:
* [ ] (Will add specific limitations as they arise during development, e.g., rate limiting, limited data sources, hallucination risks.)
